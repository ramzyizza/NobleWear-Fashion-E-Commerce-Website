# NobleWear - Fashion E-Commerce Website

### NOTE:

This project is a significant part of the final workshop on the Implementation of Software Design at Universitas Gadjah Mada. The objective is to design a robust software system, emphasizing the backend and architectural components.

Utilizing existing projects from platforms like GitHub is allowed for the purpose of this workshop, as long as original authors are credited, and significant backend and architectural modifications are made to enhance the system. This practice is not deemed as plagiarism. The primary focus of the course is on backend development and system architecture, and the assessment will revolve around the complexity and new features introduced. The front-end of NobleWear has been adapted from existing projects to enhance the user experience while the majority of backend functionalities were developed as part of this course.
